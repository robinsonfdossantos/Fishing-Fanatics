# Fising-Fanatics
Share your fishing spots with fellow fish fanatics

## Description

## USER STORY 
```
As a fishing enthusiast,

I WANT to be able to share my fishing spots with fellow fish people

So they too can share their spots and we can rate each other's spots, comment and possibly visit those spots in future.

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

THEN the home page should include a nav bar with "Home", "Login" and "Sign up" buttons.

THEN I am taken to a new page with a "Login" and "Signup" form.

WHEN I log in as an existing user or I sign-up as a new user, 
THEN I am presented with a new page displaying the 4 seasons with images representing each season.

WHEN I click on a season,
THEN I am taken to a new page displaying previous fishing posts for that season, a form to post a new fishing spot and a form to add a new specie of fish caught which is not part of the existing species in the drop-down list.

WHEN I fill-out the form to post a new fishing spot,
THEN my post is displayed alongside other posts from previous users

THEN I am greeted with four seasons to choose from

WHEN I choose a season

THEN I can input my favourite spot (maybe an image) maybe co-ordinates, when I last fished there and what fish I caught
